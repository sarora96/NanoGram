# NanoGram
Image Sharing application. Built on Parse server on AWS.

## About NanoGram ##

A big motivation for me to pursue NanoGram was to understand how images are loaded onto servers and transmitted to multiple users. 
By understanding how byte arrays are used to store images and recreate them on devices, I was able to accomplish my goal. 

## How I built NanoGram ## 

NanoGram was built with extensive help from two particular sources - Udemy and YouTube.
I decided to enroll myself in an Android Development course on Udemy to improve my skills and used YouTube as a source whenever
I had any confusion regarding the material. I value online resources immensely since they give me opportunities to explore 
skills that I ordinarily would not have the chance to try in a school environment. 

## Issues with NanoGram ##

Currently, NanoGram is unable to store more than 1 image per user. There is unreliable behavior when a user uploads more than 
one image. I am trying to find workarounds to this but have been unsuccessful so far. 

Another issue is that users have to log out and log back in in order to see new pictures uploaded during the time that the user
was active on the app. Real time update should not be too difficult to incorporate but that is another aspect I need to consider.
